# Governance

## DAO <a href="#9a14" id="9a14"></a>

The current DAO (ref-finance.sputnik-dao.near) uses SputnikDAO contract to manage its affairs.&#x20;

The DAO has two different roles:

1. **Council**: Council members can create proposals and vote. Only Council members can create proposals. If the majority of the Council confirms or rejects a proposal, that decision will stand
2. **Community**: Community members can vote on proposals. If the majority of the Community confirms or rejects a proposal, that decision will stand. For most proposals, the Council will defer to the Community's decision, and refrain from voting

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to the above Sputnik DAO, veToken holders can participate in the governance of the protocol, by [voting](broken-reference) on key proposals.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Core Values <a href="#9a26" id="9a26"></a>

Beyond voting power, anyone in our community is welcomed and encouraged to participate in the activities of the project, including, but not limited to:

* **Project Management**: planning, project methodology, and documentation
* **Product Testing**: unit test and end-to-end test
* **Product Strategy**: benchmark, market analysis, and go-to-market plan
* **User Support and Moderation**
* **PR and Communication**

In addition to proactiveness, Community members shall:

* Challenge project proposals
* Share their opinion about different matters raised by the Community
* Be proactive and act in the protocolâ€™s best interests
* Exercise independent judgement (Community members should not be delegates who simply implement the commands of other parties)
* Exercise their voting right
* Participate in the Community calls and meetups
