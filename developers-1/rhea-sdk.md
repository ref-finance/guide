# RHEA SDK

## Introduction

RHEA SDK is designed to assist developers when interacting with the main functions of the protocol. Main functions that can be defined as:

* Trade: Swap tokens with our Automated Market Maker (AMM)

* Farm: Stake LP tokens into farms and earn liquidity incentives (Coming soon)
* Boost Farm: Stake LOVE tokens to get boosted liquidity incentives (Coming soon)

You can find detailed introduction and guide in this [github link](https://github.com/ref-finance/ref-sdk).

## RHEA Swap Widget

If you're a project developer looking to integrate the RHEA Swap functionality into your own application, we recommend using the Ref Swap Widget.

The RHEA Swap Widget is a useful tool, allowing any third party service to access RHEA's liquidity. Users of ecosystem dapps have the ability to swap via the Widget, without the need to go to Ref app, thus improving the user experience.

Here are some use cases:

* Swapping stablecoins for your project's token
* Swapping tokens to lend, farm or stake
* Swapping one token for a specific token, which can be used to buy a NFT in the associated marketplace

Using the RHEA Swap Widget, with a few customizations, developers can integrate the Swap funtion directly into their dapps. Both mobile and/or website version are available.&#x20;

For the default theme, developers can chose between the light mode and dark mode. We also provide a lot more themes for you to choose from.

Follow the [guide ](https://github.com/ref-finance/ref-sdk#ref-swap-widget)here to start integration.
