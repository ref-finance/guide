## What is Ref Finance?

### Community project

Ref Finance is built as one of the core projects in the Defi Ecosystem on NEAR Protocol. Its main objective is to bring together many core components of Defi, namely: Decentralized Exchange \(DEX\), Lending Protocol, a synthetic asset issuer etc,... into a single, synchronous Defi Platform.

Ref is first and foremost a community project. A [DAO](https://v2.sputnik.fund/#/ref-finance.sputnik-dao.near) has been created to allow the community to direct the project. The DAO will be responsible for managing the treasury initially, and shortly thereafter, managing upgrades of the protocol.
