By clicing on "Portfolio", you can view your portfolio on Orderly.

By clicking on "Liquidations," you can access information about liquidation events related to your account.

## Adjust Max Account Leverage&#x20;

Perps  currently offers only cross-margin mode. You can adjust the max account leverage in account information.

In addition to affecting your buying power, the max account leverage will also impact the margin ratio and maintenance margin ratio displayed in your account.

When you are ready to close a position, you can either place an order that is opposite to your current position just as opening positions  or directly click on "Close" in the "Positions" section to initiate the closing process. When closing positions using the "Close" button, you can adjust the position size you wish to close and choose between a market order or setting a limit order.

Please note that after closing a position, the realized profit and loss won't automatically be transferred to your spot trading account. You need to settle your profit and loss so that they are reflected in your balance.&#x20;

There are two ways to settle your profit and loss.

1. Navigate to "Orderly Portfolio" -> "Assets" -> "Futures" to settle.&#x20;
