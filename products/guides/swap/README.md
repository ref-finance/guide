# Trading

The Lite and Pro tabs are two versions available for trading one token for another. The Lite version offers a user-friendly swap interface where you can select the two tokens you wish to exchange and click the swap button. On the other hand, the Pro version provides additional advanced functions to assist you with more comprehensive trade signals.

The liquidity on Ref Finance is provided by Liquidity Providers (LPs) who stake their tokens in the associated 'Pools'. In return, they receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can be staked to earn REF and other tokens in the 'Farms'.&#x20;

When you trade (swap) on Ref Finance, you will pay the pool fee (trading fee), which is broken down as follows:

For traders, the fee is always taken on the amount paid. The Protocol and Referral fees translate into LP tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
For regular pools (Swap function), if there is no account to receive the Referral Fee, it goes to all LPs of that pool as a form of increased LP tokens.x3

For stablecoin pools (StableSwap function), if there is no account to receive the Referral Fee, it goes to the Protocol Fee as a form of increased LP tokens.
