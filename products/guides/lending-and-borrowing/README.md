# Lending & Borrowing

The lending & borrowing platform is a decentralized, non-custodial, pool-based interest rates platform that enables users to supply assets to earn interest, and to borrow against them to unlock liquidity, similar in nature to Aave, Compound, and other pool-based protocols.

The platform runs natively on the NEAR blockchain, a layer 1, proof-of-stake, sharded blockchain with a WebAssembly runtime. The protocol's smart contracts are written in Rust.

The protocol aims to unlock liquidity for interest-bearing assets, particularly layer 1 staking derivatives such as stNEAR and stETH. For instance, users will be able to deposit stNEAR as collateral, then borrow more NEAR to create a leveraged staking position, or borrow a stablecoin to create a self-repaying position.
