# Farming

Farming or Yield Farming is defined as the process of staking your LP tokens into a farm, to earn additional rewards, on top of your existing liquidity position(s) swap fee revenue.

Like pools, all farms are contained in one single contract (v2.ref-farming.near). Plus, a farm can support up to 16 different reward tokens.

Liquidity incentives are usually used by projects' owners to attract liquidity and to facilitate trading.

## How to farm?

First, make sure that you are connected to Ref Finance with your wallet.

### Step 1: Click on Farms and choose a relevent pool

In the Farms section, you can view all old, live, and future farms and filter them by different criteria.

To farm, you need LP tokens, which means you need to provide liquidity initially for the corresponding pool. To provide liquidity, please refer to the [Pooling section](../overview/pooling.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Farms are limited to a certain number of pools, not all pools have a yield farming option &#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can check the associated pool of a farm by either clicking on the pool, choosing Add liquidity or Get LP Tokens

### Step 2: Click on Stake after adding liquidity

Note that you can do some yield simulations by clicking on ROI calculator. Please be careful as the simulations are 'other things being equal' (i.e. not taking into account potential Divergence Loss).

Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to stake.
