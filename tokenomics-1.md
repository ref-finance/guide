## Token Utility&#x20;

### The $RHEA Token Stack: Three Tokens, One Ecosystem <a href="#id-4dc2" id="id-4dc2"></a>

To meet the diverse needs of protocol growth, user rewards, and governance, RHEA operates on a **three-token structure**:



### 1. RHEA — The Core Asset <a href="#id-5149" id="id-5149"></a>

$RHEA is the foundational utility and governance token of the RHEA ecosystem.

All value accrual mechanisms, fees, and growth are ultimately directed to $RHEA holders.

**Key Roles:**

* Base asset for staking and liquidity provision across the RHEA ecosystem
* Primary conversion target for oRHEA incentives
* Captures value from lending, trading, and treasury flows



### 2. xRHEA — Staked, Escrowed <a href="#aa49" id="aa49"></a>

xRHEA represents **staked RHEA** and unlocks advanced features and deeper utility across the protocol.

It is **non-transferable** and acts as a signal of long-term commitment to RHEA.

**xRHEA Utility:**

* Earns staking incentives in the form of oRHEA
* Used as gas within the RHEA ecosystem
* Boosts yield multiplier when staked
* Can be supplied as collateral in RHEA’s lending markets and partner protocols
* Determines **on-chain reputation and conversion multiplier** for oRHEA → RHEA



### 3. oRHEA — The Reputation-Weighted Incentive Token <a href="#aa49" id="aa49"></a>

oRHEA is a **non-transferable, reputation-based incentive token** earned through active participation:

* Generated through activities across the RHEA ecosystem, including Liquidity Provision and lending (with varying weights)
* Distributed via campaigns and partner integrations

**Conversion Mechanics:**

* Convertible to RHEA
* Conversion ratio is based on **on-chain reputation**, determined by a user’s xRHEA balance and holding duration
* Max ratio: **1 oRHEA : 1 RHEA**
* Distributed on a **seasonal basis** from a fixed emissions pool

oRHEA replaces traditional point systems and serves as the **core of long-term incentivization** across the ecosystem.
