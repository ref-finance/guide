# Vault

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To realize RHEA's vision as a DeFi yiel Hub powered by NEAR Chain Signature, RHEA has developed the Vault feature—a dedicated page that will gradually list all DeFi projects within the NEAR ecosystem, providing clear and concise introductions to each project's core offerings.

#### Vault will be developed in three iterative phases:

* **Phase 1**: List detailed information on each product’s main features, along with direct links for easy navigation.
* **Phase 2**: Enable direct interactions within the Vault page, removing the need to navigate away.
* **Phase 3**: Integrate functions across different Vaults to allow seamless interaction, fully achieving the one-stop financial platform vision.
