# APY

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

\
Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is the compounding interest on a deposit or a loan after a year, calculated based on the initial principal. Each asset has its own market of supply and demand with its own APY that evolves with time.

## Supply APY <a href="#supply-apy" id="supply-apy"></a>

Supply APY is the current interest APY of the asset when you supply. Each asset has a different set of parameters that determines its actual yield at different points. You may find more details about the  interest rate model [here](how-lending-and-borrowing-works/interest-rate-model.md).

When you supply, you may get liquidity mining rewards like BRRR, USN, or other tokens. As a result, the actual supply APY may be higher.

## Borrow APY

Borrow APY is the current interest APY of the asset when you borrow. Each asset has a different set of parameters that determines its actual yield at different points. You may find more details about the interest rate model [here](how-lending-and-borrowing-works/interest-rate-model.md).

When you borrow, you may get liquidity mining rewards. As a result, the actual borrow APY may be lower.
