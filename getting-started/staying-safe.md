# Staying Safe

## NEVER trust someone pretending to work for the 'Customer Support Team' <a href="#trader-joe-has-no-formal-customer-support-team" id="trader-joe-has-no-formal-customer-support-team"></a>

<mark style="color:red;">Ref Finance has NO formal 'Customer Support Team'.</mark>

We will **NEVER**:

❌ Send you a direct message claiming to represent customer support or someone working directly for the team

❌ Ask you for your private key or recovery phrase&#x20;

​If you're having trouble, please contact us directly via our [official social channels](../community.md).

## ALWAYS use Ref Finance verified domains <a href="#always-use-trader-joe-verified-domains" id="always-use-trader-joe-verified-domains"></a>
