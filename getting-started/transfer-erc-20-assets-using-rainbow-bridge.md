# Using the Rainbow Bridge

The Rainbow Bridge allows you to transfer tokens between **Ethereum**, **NEAR** and the **Aurora** networks. The bridge was created and is maintained by Aurora, the Ethereum-compatible scaling solution built on NEAR.

## Guide

The following guide will show you how to use it:

1. Prepare ERC-20 assets in your non-custodial Wallet (Metamask, Coin98, etc.)
2. Use the Rainbow Bridge to transfer tokens to NEAR Protocol
3. Access [https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer), connect your NEAR Wallet and MetaMask Wallet

### Step 1: Choose Ethereum <> NEAR route and connect both wallets
